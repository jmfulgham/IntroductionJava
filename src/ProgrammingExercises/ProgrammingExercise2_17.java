 Programming Exercise 2.17: Science - Wind-Chill Temperature
 How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not enough to provide the answer. Other factor's including wind speed,
 relative humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001, the National Weather
 Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to measure coldness using temperature and wind speed. The
 formula is:
 twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v^0.16 + 0.4275ta*v^0.16
 where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, v is th speed measured in miles per hour, and twc is
 the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58 degrees
 Fahrenheit or above 41 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 degrees and 41 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind
 speed greater than or equal to 2 then display the wind-chill temperature. Use Math.pow(a,b) to compute v^0.16
