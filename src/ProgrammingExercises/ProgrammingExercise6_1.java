/** Programming Exercise 6.1: Math - Pentagonal Numbers
 * A pentagonal number is defined as n(3n-1)/2 for n = 1, 2, ..., and so on. Therefore, the first few numbers are 1, 5,
 * 12, 22, ... . Write a method with the following header that returns a pentagonal number:
 *  public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)
 * For example, getPentagonalNumber(1) returns 1 and getPentagonalNumber(2) returns 5. Write a test program that uses
 * this method to display the first 100 pentagonal numbers with 10 numbers on each line. Use the %7d format to display
 * each number.
