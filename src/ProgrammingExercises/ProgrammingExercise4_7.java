Programming Exercises 4.7: Corner Point Coordinates
Suppose a pentagon is centered at (0,0) with one point at the 0 o'clock position, as shown in figure 4.4c. Write a
program that prompts the user to enter the radius of the bounding circle of a pentagon and displays the coordinates of
the five corner points on the pentagon from p1 to p5 in this order. Use console format to display two digits after the
decimal point.
        x = r*cos(a)
        y = r*sin(a)
