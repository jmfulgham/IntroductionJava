 Programming Exercises 3.3: Algebra - Solve Linear Equations
 A linear equation can be solved using Cramer's rule given in Programming Exercise 1.13. Write a program that prompts the
 user to enter a,b,c,d,e, and f and displays the result. If ad - bc is 0, report that "The equation has no solution."
 Cramer's rule:
 ax + by = e             ed - bf         af - ec
 x = -------    y =  -------
 cx + dy = f             ad - bc         ad - bc
