 Programming Exercise 2.12: Physics - Find Runway Length
 Given an airplane's acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane
 to take off using the formula:
 v^2
 length = -----
 2a
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in meters/second squared
 (m/s^2), then, displays the minimum runway length.
