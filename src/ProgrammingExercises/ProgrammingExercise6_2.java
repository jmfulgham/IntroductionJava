/**
 * Programming Exercise 6.2: Sum the digits of an integer
 * Write a method that computes the sum of the digits in an integer. Use the following header:
 *      public static int sumDigits(long n)
 * For example, sumDigits(234) returns 9( = 2 + 3 + 4). (Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits and the / operator
 * to remove the extracted digit. For instance, to extract 4 from 234, use 234 % 10(=4). To remove 4 from 234, use
 * 234 / 10(=23)). Use a loop to repeatedly extract and remove the digit until all the digits are extracted. Write a
 * test program that prompts the user to enter an integer then displays the sum of all its digits.
