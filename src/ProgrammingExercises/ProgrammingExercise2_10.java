 Programming Exercise 2.10: Science: Calculating Energy
 Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
 Your program should prompt the user to enter in the amount of water in kilograms and the inital and final temperatures
 of the water. The formula to compute energy is
 Q = M * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature) * 4184
 where M is the weight of the water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is
 measured in joules.
