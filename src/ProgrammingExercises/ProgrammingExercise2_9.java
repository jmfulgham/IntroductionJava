 Programming Exercise 2.9: Physics - Acceleration
 Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time taken to mmake the change, as given by
 he following formula:
 v1 - v0
 a = ---------
 t
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters per second, the ending velocity in
 meters per second, and the time span t in seconds, then displays the average velocity.
