Programming Exercises 4.6: Random Points On A Circle
Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 40 and displays three angles
in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in figure 4.4a. (Hint: Generate a random angle a in radians between
0 and 2PI, as shown in 4.4b and the point determined by this angle is ((r^x)*cos(a), (r^x)*sin(a)).)
x = r*cos(a) and y = r*sin(a)

  c=sqrt((x1−x2)^2+(y1−y2)^2)
  cos A = (b^2 + c^2 − a^2) / 2bc
  cos B = (c^2 + a^2 − b^2) / 2ca
