 Programming Exercise 2.13: Financial Application: Compound Value
 Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings ccount with an annual interest rate of 5%. Thus, the monthly interest
 rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes
 100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
 After the second month, the value in the account becomes
 (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
 After the third month, the value in the account becomes
 (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
 and so on. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly savings amount and displays the account value after
 the sixth month.
