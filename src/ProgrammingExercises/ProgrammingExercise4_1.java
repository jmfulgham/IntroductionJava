 Programming Exercises 4.1: Geometry - Area of a Pentagon
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area
 of the pentagon. The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is Area = (5*s^2)/(4*tan(PI/5)), where s is the length
 of a side. The side can be computed using the formula s = 2*r*sin(PI/5), where r is the length from the center of a
 pentagon to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point.
