 Programming Exercise 2.15: Geometry - Distance of Two Points
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance. The formula
 for computing distance is square root ((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Note you can use Math.ow(a, 0.5) to compute square root
 of a.
