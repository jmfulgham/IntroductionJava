/**
 * Programming Exercise 3.9: Business - ISBN-10 (International Standard Book Number)
 * consists of 10 digits: d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9d10. The last digit, d10, is a checksum, which is calculated from the other
 * 9 digits using the formula:
 *      (d1 * 1 + d2*2 + d3 * 3 + ... + d9 * 9)%11
 * If the checksum is 10, the last digit is denoted as X according to to the ISBN-10 convention. Write a program that
 * prompts the usr to enter the first 9 digits and displays the 10-digit ISB N (including leading zeros). Your program
 * should read the input as an integer.
