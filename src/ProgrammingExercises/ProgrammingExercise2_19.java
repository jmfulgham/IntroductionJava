 Programming Exercise 2.19: Geometry -  Area of a Triangle
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter three points, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), of a triangle then
 then displays its area. The formula for computing the area of a triangle is
 s = (side1 + side2 + side3)/2;
 area = squareroot((s)(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3))
