/**
 * Programming Exercise 6.3: Palindrome Integer
 * Write methods with the follwoing headers:
 *      //Return the reversal of an integer, e.g., reverse(456) returns 654
 *      public static int reverse(int number)
 *
 *      //Return true if number is a palindrome
 *      public static boolean isPalindrome(int number)
 *Use the reverse method to implement isPalindrome. A number is a palindrome if its reversal is the same as itself.
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer and reports whether the integer is a palindrome.
