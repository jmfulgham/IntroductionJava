/**
 * Programming Exercise 3.18: Cost of Shipping
 * A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of
 * the package (in pounds).
 *
 *                  |3.5, if 0 < w <= 1
 *                  |5.5, if 1 < w <= 3
 *          c(w) =  |8.5, if 3 < w <= 10
 *                  |10.5, if 10 < w <= 20
 *
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and displays the shipping cost. If the weight
 * is negative or zero, display a message "Invalid input." If the weight is greater than 20, display a message "The
 * package cannot be shipped."
