/**
 * Programming Exercise 6.7: Financial Application - Compute the Future Investment Value
 * Write a method that computes future investment value at a given interest rate for a specified number of years. The
 * future investment is determined using the formula in Programming Exercise 2.21.
 *      futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfYears*12)
 * Use the following method header:
 *      public static double futureInvestmentValue(double investmentAmount, double monthlyInterestRate, int years)
 * For example, futureInvestmentValue(10000, 0.05/12, 5) returns 12833.59.
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the investment amount (e.g., 1,000) and the interest rate (e.g.,9%)
 * and prints a table that displays future value for the years from 1 to 30.
