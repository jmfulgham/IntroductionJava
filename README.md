This is not meant to be sold or used for any other purpose than my practice in learning Java and using git. The credit for the information for the notes and the questions themselves goes to Y. Daniel Liang. Please go out and buy his book. Introduction to Java: Programming and Structures 11th Edition. Thank You!
